# What is Obsidian?

Obsidian is an analytics tool that enables you to capture data on the costs associated with your users on your digital product. Obsidian then lets you analyse this data with simple, interactive dashboard that let you find out who your expensive customers, features, and vendors are.

## What you need?

To make the most of Obsidian, we recommend connecting at least 1 bank account and event based data using either our API or Segment Webhook (more coming soon).

## Introduction to Data Model

Obsidian's data model is built on top of two components - **events** and **users**.

### Events

An event is simply an action by a user. It can be a _page_view_, _checkout_, or any action defined by you.

### Users

On the other side of an event is a user i.e., the individual who took the action on your product.
